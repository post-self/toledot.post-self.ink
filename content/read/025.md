> At time of writing, the Bălan clade is made up of two personalities in the form of three individuals: Ioan Bălan, the root instance, remains on the L<sub>5</sub> System, and Codrin Bălan travels on the Launch Vehicles (hereafter "LVs"). Two persons, three instances.
>
> Both of these persons, all of three of these instances, are entangled with the Ode clade. Ioan Bălan has worked extensively with May Then My Name Die With Me of the Ode clade, and Codrin Bălan has worked with and is in a polyamorous relationship which includes Dear, Also The Tree That Was Felled of the Ode clade. The fact that the Ode clade (also written "Odists") was instrumental in both Secession and Launch is undeniable, and the fact that the Bălan clade is entangled with the Odists is equally so.

> For reasons that will be made clear as this history unfolds, we are not able to recuse ourselves. You must bear with us, and you will see why we, the Bălan clade, *must* be the ones to write this history.
